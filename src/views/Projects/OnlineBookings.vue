      <h5>Background</h5>
      <p class="space-btm-med">
        Included as part of the service Nookal provides is an Online Bookings system. Customers of Nookal can obtain a hyperlink or button that can be included on their website or in emails which allows their patients to book services online.
      </p>
      <h5>Problem</h5>
      <p class="space-btm-med">
        The Online Booking System was already several years old and since its creation the customers expectations, wants and needs had changed significantly. It was clear that the systemâ€™s look and feel had become outdated and needed a refresh.
      </p>
      <h5>Goals</h5>
      <p>
        As the current system is being used by over 50K users every day, it was vital that any changes did not remove any functionality. I wanted to gain insights during the research phase to understand what features would be most beneficial to include. Lastly I wanted to create a modern interface and user experience for the Online Bookings Platform, by putting our customers and their patients at the forefront of my design decisions.

      <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
      <h5>Current State Evaluation</h5>
      <p>To understand the current experience and pain points in the online booking process, I decided to evaluate the current user flow and review the data and information presented to the end user. Here are some of the most important things that I discovered:</p>
      <div class="note-holder">
        <div class="note">
          The look and feel of our platform on web, tablet and mobile is very outdated.
        </div>
        <div class="note">It would be better to separate services and classes, rather than listing them together.</div>
        <div class="note">The Service and Class details list makes it difficult to find a specific type.</div>
        <div class="note">The user flow is overly complicated with too many steps.</div>

      <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
      <p>Next I started competitive analysis by reviewing several of our main competitors that were offering similar online booking services. This gave me a solid grounding for understanding the current standards of online booking systems in terms of the features and user expectations. These were the platforms I reviewed:</p>

      <p class="space-top-med">The research highlighted areas where our Online Bookings Platform had fallen behind our competitors. To ensure the new platform was successful my solutions would have to ensure the following:</p>
      <div class="flexed-col">
        <div class="points">Modern user interface</div>
        <div class="points">Improved input interactions and validation</div>
        <div class="points">Expanded Practitioner and Location searching</div>
        <div class="points">Ability to filter services and classes by category type</div>
        <div class="points">Additional location, practitioner, service and class information</div>
      </div>

    </div>

  <div class="page vert-space-lge">
    <div class="content">
      <h1>Understand</h1>
      <h5>Reviewing Client Feedback</h5>
      <p>As the online booking platform had existed for several years, during that time I had gathered feedback from our Clients who had expressed the need for additional functionality. Several features that were suggested were considered for the final feature set, these were: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The ability for the user to book multiple classes at once.</li>
        <li>Different users expressed the need to allow the end user to choose a practitioner before a location and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Able to either show a goodbye message or link to an external site on a complete booking.</li>
        <li>Able to quickly choose the first available practitioner.</li>
        <li>Able to show or hide appointment times and time lengths.</li>
        <li>Improved easier to user interface, with not so many steps.</li>
        <li>Many issues raised with the mobile and tablet experience.</li>
        <li>The ability to customise colour settings to match branding.</li>
        <li>The ability to add background images.</li>

      </ul>

      <h5>Round Table Discussions</h5>
      <p class="space-btm-sml">I reached out to several clients who had provided feedback on the Online Bookings platform and was able to meet either locally or on zoom for a round table discussion. These meetings gave me the opportunity to go into more detail of their wants, needs and expectations of the platform.</p>
      <p class="space-btm-sml">A common theme in these meetings was the differing needs of each Clinic in terms of the user journey. Questions in the round table highlighted that much of this was caused by the differing sizes of each clinic. I was able to sketch out and brainstorm ideas in these meetings, which gave me confidence in the proposed solutions.</p>

      Here are some of the key points from these meetings:
      <ul>
        <li>Some clinics had many locations with many practitioners. So allowing an easy way for the user to choose from all options available was needed.</li>
        <li>Other clinics only had one location and did not need this extra complexity and wanted the user to start by choosing from their practitioners.</li>
        <li>Other clinics wanted to be able to provide their patients with an easy way to book and rebook with a specific provider.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All the clients were open to beta testing, which would help me ensure that the features and mockups generated by these meetings would keep the design process on track.</p>

      <h1>Understand</h1>
      <h5>Personas</h5>
      <p>I created personas to help identify and explore the key user groups that I am designing the platform for. The persons helped to guide my design decisions and ensured I created solutions that best suits the end users.</p>

      <h5>User Journey Flow Charts</h5>
      <p>As discovered in the round table meetings, I needed to create several use cases solutions to meet each of these needs. I used Flow Charts to document the different user journeys to give me a visual representation.</p>
      <h5>Full User Journey</h5>
      <p>The clinic has several locations with many practitioners at each location. All locations and practitioners need to be available to the patient.</p>
      <h5>Standard User Journey</h5>
      <p> The bulk of our users operate from one Location but can have many practitioners. This user flow allows the user start at the practitioner step.</p>
      <h5>Quick User Journey</h5>
      <p>Clinicâ€™s would like to list practitionerâ€™s on their website and would like a link to allow the user to book with the selected practitioner. Also users wanted to be able to provide a quick link for patients to rebook with the same practitioner. This user flow shows how this is achieved.</p>

        <h5>Wireframe Mockups</h5>
        <p>I started creating wireframe mockups, by taking what I learnt during the round table interviews. I had a concept in mind for how the page should interact with the user and I reworked a few different layout types, until I settled on one that I felt worked the best in terms of page space and presentation.</p>

        <h5>Low Resolution Mockups</h5>
        <p>Next I moved onto low resolution mockups to flesh out the interface and the elements. During this phase I was guided by my prior research especially the client feedback. This was done to ensure all relevant features and improvements were included in the system.</p>

      <h3>User Customisation</h3>
      <p>Feedback from clients had showed it was important to them for the ability to customise the look and feel of the platform to match their branding and create a point of difference from their competitors. To facilitate this clients are able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Upload practitioner, location, service and class images.</li>
          <li>Customise the colours used throughout the platform to match branding.</li>
          <li>Add a background image.</li>

      <h3>Tablet UI</h3>
      <p>The tablet layout required several key changes from when using the platform on a desktop. These included adding a Navigation Header, containing global functionality. To conform to tablet design standards and to allow for many practitioners or locations to be easily viewed, I restyled the location and practitioner selection screens into a list view.</p>

      <h1>Test</h1>
      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>Overall the new platform was received with many positive comments and feedback during the Usability Testing phase. The streamlined flow, vastly improved tablet and mobile experience satisfied the needs of many different sized clinics.</p>
      <p>During this phase I was able to gather useful feedback from client testers that allowed me to make several improvements to the UI, these included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow services and classes to be grouped by categories.</li>
        <li>Further customisation at the end of the sales flow to allow the user to return to the clients website, receive a goodbye message or a combination of both.</li>
        <li>Added functionality for services and classes to be reordered.</li>
        <li>The option to show or hide qualification information for practitioners.</li>
        <li>In the web view the default setting when selecting a date is the month view over the week view.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>While working on this project I learnt to lean on the information discovered during the Understand phase. This allowed me to not rely on preconceived ideas I had break away from the layout issues plaguing the initial version, especially for tablet and mobile. I thoroughly enjoyed the Usability phase, as it allowed me to take on valuable feedback which only helped to improve the end-users experience.</p>
