        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
          Included as part of the service Nookal provides is an Online Bookings system. Customers of Nookal can obtain a hyperlink or button that can be included on their website or in emails which allows their clients to book services online.
        </p>

        <h5>Problem</h5>
        <p>
          The Online Booking System that was currently being used was already several years old and since that time the customers expectations had changed. It was also noted that the system’s look and feel had become outdated and needed a refresh.
        </p>

        <h5>My Impact</h5>
        <p>
          Being the solo UX/UI designer on this project I wanted to obtain a clear understanding of what was the industry standards in terms of Online Bookings Platforms for the Allied health Industry. My research was able to guide me documenting the requirements and creating iterations of low resolutions mockups. Once the overall concept was approved by all relevant Stakeholders I was able to move on to high resolution mockups, prototypes and user testing.
        </p>

        <h5>Goals</h5>
        <p>
          Modernising the UX/UI the Online Bookings Platform, whilst putting our clients and their customers at the forefront of my design decisions. As the current system is being used by over 100K users every day, it was vital that any changes did not remove any of the current functionality and adding functionality did not cause unnecessary confusion when setting up the system for our clients, or making a booking for their customers.

        <h5>Current State Evaluation</h5>
        <p>To understand the current experience and pain points in the online booking process, I decided to evaluate the current user flow and review the data amd information presented to the end user.   Here are some of the most important things that I discovered: </p>

         <ul>
           <li>The look and feel of our platform is very outdated.</li>
           <li>To reduce the cognitive load on the user it would be better to separate services and classes, rather than listing them together.</li>
           <li>The Service and Class information is shown as a text list and needs improvement to enable our clients to sell their services and classes more effectively.</li>
           <li>The user flow is overly complicated with too many steps and no customisation options.</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
      <p>Next I started competitive analysis by reviewing several of our competitors that were offering similar online booking services. I completed a deep dive of our competitor’s by reviewing each product in detail by reviewing the sites features and ease of use. This gave me a good understanding of the current standard for online booking systems in terms of the feature set and end user expectations. The competitors I reviewed included:</p>

        <div class="image">
          <h5>Mindbody</h5>
          <h6><a href="https://www.mindbodyonline.com/explore">https://www.mindbodyonline.com</a></h6>
          <img class="screenshot" src="../../assets/images/ob-mind-body.png" alt="Mind and Body screenshot" />
        </div>
        <div class="image">
          <h5>Health Engine</h5>
          <h6><a href="https://healthengine.com.au/">https://www.healthengine.com.au</a></h6>
          <img class="screenshot" src="../../assets/images/ob-health-engine.png" alt="HealthEngine screenshot" />
        </div>
        <div class="image">
          <h5>HotDoc</h5>

          <img class="screenshot" src="../../assets/images/ob-hotdoc.png" alt="Hotdoc screenshot" />
        </div>
      </div>


      <p class="space-top-sml">I finalised this process by completing a SWOT analysis, which further highlighted areas that our Online Bookings Platform was falling behind competitors. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modern user interface</li>
        <li>Improved input interactions and validation</li>
        <li>Expanded Practitioner and Location searching</li>
        <li>Ability to filter services and classes by category type</li>
        <li>Additional location, practitioner, service and class information</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="page space-top-lge space-btm-lge">
    <div class="content">
      <h1>Understand</h1>
      <h5>Reviewing Client Feedback</h5>
      <p>As the online booking platform had existed for several years, during that time I had gathered feedback from our Clients who had expressed the need for additional functionality. Several features that were suggested were considered for the final feature set, these were: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The ability for the user to book multiple classes at once.</li>
        <li>Different users expressed the need to allow the end user to choose a practitioner before a location and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Able to either show a goodbye message or link to an external site on a complete booking.</li>
        <li>Able to quickly choose the first available practitioner and booking.</li>
        <li>Able to show or hide appointment times and time lengths.</li>
        <li>Improved interface for our clients for creating an Online Booking Link.</li>
        <li>The ability to customise colours settings to match branding.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Round Table Discussions</h5>
      <p class="space-btm-sml">I reached out to several clients who had provided feedback on the Online Bookings platform and was able to meet either locally or on zoom for a round table discussion. These meetings gave me the opportunity to go into more detail of their wants, needs and expectations of the platform.</p>
      <p class="space-btm-sml">A common theme in these meetings was the differing needs of each Clinic in terms of the user journey. Questions in the round table highlighted that much of this was caused by the differing sizes of each clinic. I was able to sketch out and brainstorm ideas in these meetings, which gave me confidence in the proposed solutions.</p>

      Here are some of the key points from these meetings:
      <ul>
        <li>Some clinics had many locations with many practitioners. So allowing an easy way for the user to choose from all options available was needed.</li>
        <li>Other clinics only had one location and did not need this extra complexity and wanted the user to start by choosing from their practitioners.</li>
        <li>Other clinics wanted to be able to provide their patients with an easy way to book and rebook with a specific provider.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All the clients were open to beta testing, which would help me ensure that the features and mockups generated by these meetings would keep the design process on track.</p>

      <h1>Understand</h1>
      <h5>Personas</h5>
      <p>I created personas to help identify and explore the key user groups that I am designing the platform for. The persons helped to guide my design decisions and ensured I created solutions that best suits the end users.</p>

      <h5>User Journey Flow Charts</h5>
      <p>As discovered in the round table meetings, I needed to create several use cases solutions to meet each of these needs. I used Flow Charts to document the different user journeys to give me a visual representation.</p>
      <h5>Full User Journey</h5>
      <p>The clinic has several locations with many practitioners at each location. All locations and practitioners need to be available to the patient.</p>

      <p> The bulk of our users operate from one Location but can have many practitioners. This user flow allows the user start at the practitioner step.</p>

      <h5>Quick User Journey</h5>
      <p>Clinic’s would like to list practitioner’s on their website and would like a link to allow the user to book with the selected practitioner. Also users wanted to be able to provide a quick link for patients to rebook with the same practitioner. This user flow shows how this is achieved.</p>

        <h5>Wireframe Mockups</h5>
        <p>I started creating wireframe mockups, by taking what I learnt during the round table interviews. I had a concept in mind for how the page should interact with the user and I reworked a few different layout types, until I settled on one that I felt worked the best in terms of page space and presentation.</p>

        <h5>Low Resolution Mockups</h5>
        <p>Next I moved onto low resolution mockups to flesh out the interface and the elements. During this phase I was guided by my prior research especially the client feedback. This was done to ensure all relevant features and improvements were included in the system.</p>
