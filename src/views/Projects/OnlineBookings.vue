      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p class="space-btm-med">
        Included as part of the service Nookal provides is an Online Bookings system. Customers of Nookal can obtain a hyperlink or button that can be included on their website or in emails which allows their patients to book services online.
      </p>
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p class="space-btm-med">
        The Online Booking System was already several years old and since its creation the customers expectations, wants and needs had changed significantly. It was clear that the system’s look and feel had become outdated and needed a refresh.
      </p>
      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <p>
        As the current system is being used by over 50K users every day, it was vital that any changes did not remove any functionality. I wanted to gain insights during the research phase to understand what features would be most beneficial to include. Lastly I wanted to create a modern interface and user experience for the Online Bookings Platform, by putting our customers and their patients at the forefront of my design decisions.

      <h4>Current State Evaluation</h4>
      <p>To understand the current experience and pain points in the online booking process, I decided to evaluate the current user flow and review the data and information presented to the end user. Here are some of the most important things that I discovered:</p>

      <div class="flexed top-space">
        <div class="note">The look and feel of the platform on web, tablet and mobile is very outdated.</div>
        <div class="note">It would be better to separate services and classes, rather than listing them together.</div>
        <div class="note">The service and class details list makes it difficult to find a specific type.</div>
        <div class="note">The user flow is overly complicated with too many steps.</div>

      <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
      <p>Next I started competitive analysis by reviewing several of our main competitors that were offering similar online booking services. This gave me a solid grounding for understanding the current standards of online booking systems in terms of the features and user expectations. These were the platforms I reviewed:</p>

      <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
      <p>The research highlighted areas where our Online Bookings Platform had fallen behind our competitors. To ensure the new platform was successful my solutions would have to ensure the following:</p>
      <div class="flexed-col">
        <div class="points">Modern user interface</div>
        <div class="points">Improved input interactions and validation</div>
        <div class="points">Improved practitioner, location and appointment searching and interactions</div>
        <div class="points">Ability to filter services and classes by category types</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="page vert-space-lge">
    <div class="content">
      <h4>Reviewing Client Feedback</h4>
      <p>As the online booking platform had existed for several years, during that time I had gathered feedback from our Clients who had expressed the need for additional functionality. Several features that were suggested were considered for the final feature set, these were: </p>
      <div class="flexed-col">
        <div class="points alt">The ability for the user to book multiple classes at once.</div>
        <div class="points alt">Allow the end user to choose a practitioner before a location and vice versa.</div>
        <div class="points alt">Allow passes to be sold and used for for class bookings.</div>
        <div class="points alt">Able to quickly choose the first available practitioner and location.</div>
        <div class="points alt">Improved interface with less steps to complete a booking.</div>
        <div class="points alt">The ability to customise colours settings to match branding.</div>
      </div>

      <h4 class="space-top-lge ">Round Table Discussions</h4>
      <p class="space-btm-sml">I reached out to several clients who had provided feedback on the Online Bookings platform and was able to meet either locally or on zoom for a round table discussion. These meetings gave me the opportunity to go into more detail of their wants, needs and expectations of the platform.</p>
      <p class="space-btm-sml">A common theme in these meetings was the differing needs of each Clinic in terms of the user journey. Questions in the round table highlighted that much of this was caused by the differing sizes of each clinic. I was able to sketch out and brainstorm ideas in these meetings, which helped to get everyone on the same page. All the clients were open to beta testing, which would help me ensure that the features and mockups generated by these meetings would keep the design process on track. Here are some of the key points from these meetings.</p>

      <div class="flexed space-btm-sml">
        <div class="info-card">Some clinics had many locations with many practitioners. So allowing an easy way for the user to choose from all options available was needed.</div>
        <div class="info-card alt1">Other clinics only had one location and did not need this extra complexity and wanted the user to start by choosing from their practitioners.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="flexed">
        <div class="info-card alt2">Other clinics wanted to be able to provide their patients with an easy way to book and rebook with a specific provider.</div>
        <div class="info-card alt3">All users commented that the mobile and tablet interface was frustrating and difficult to use.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="page no-bg">
    <div class="content">
      <h4>Personas</h4>
      <p>The research helped me to created three personas to identify the types of people that I am designing the platform for. These included two patients and a manager of a clinic.</p>
        <div class="personas">
          <img class="persona" src="../../assets/images/persona-1.png" alt="Persona - Sally Becker" />

      <h4>User Journey Flow Charts</h4>
      <p>As discovered in the round table meetings, I needed to create several use cases solutions to meet each of these needs. I used Flow Charts to document the different user journeys:</p>

      <div class="image-label">

      <div class="image-label">
        <h6>Quick User Journey</h6>
        <p>Clinic’s would like to list practitioner’s on their website and would like a link to allow the user to book with the selected practitioner. Also users wanted to be able to provide a quick link for patients to rebook with the same practitioner. This user flow shows how this is achieved.</p>

          <p>On the appointment screen the patient is shown all possible appointments at the location and with the practitioner they have selected.

A toggle was added to the day selector allowing the patient to choose between month and week views. Once selected the patient is shown available times. Lastly the patient clicks on the book button to confirm their selection. When booking a class the patient is given to option to book another class.

      <h4>Platform Customisation</h4>
      <p>A heavily requested feature was the customisation of the Online Bookings platform. It was very important to particular customers who wanted to maintain their branding. For most users this was not so critical, many  customers had asked for different colour options.</p>

      <div class="label-details space-top-med">
        <h6>Customising Colours</h6>
        <p>Within Nookal I have designed a UI to allow our customers to change the colours used within the online bookings platform.

      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>Overall the new platform was received with many positive comments and feedback during the Usability Testing phase. The streamlined flow, vastly improved tablet and mobile experience satisfied the needs of many different sized clinics. During this phase I was able to gather useful feedback from client testers that allowed me to make several improvements to the UI, these included:</p>
      <div class="flexed-col">
        <div class="points alt">Allow services and classes to be grouped by categories.</div>

      <h4 class="space-top-med ">Conclusion</h4>
      <p>While working on this project I learnt to lean on the information discovered during the Understand phase. This allowed me to not rely on preconceived ideas I had break away from the layout issues plaguing the initial version, especially for tablet and mobile. I thoroughly enjoyed the Usability phase, as it allowed me to take on valuable feedback which only helped to improve the end-users experience.</p>
