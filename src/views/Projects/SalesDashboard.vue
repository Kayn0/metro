          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <h5>Background</h5>
          <p>
            Nookal is a Practice Management Software Company for the Allied Health Industry. The Nookal Sales Dashboard enables Nookal sales staff to effectively manage client information and the signup journey of clients to the Nookal Platform.
          </p>

          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>
            Before the existence of the Sales Platform the signup journey was managed with Excel and a basic website showing a client list and related client data. Due to the growth of the business managing leads, trials, signups, conversations and customer communication was quickly becoming unmanageable.
          </p>

          <h5>My Impact</h5>
          <p>
            For this project I realised I needed an in-depth understanding of each step of the user journey combined with clear knowledge of the information and functionality that sales and support staff would need. To tackle this problem I leveraged the data from my in-depth research to create a new platform that could be easily integrated into the day to day operations for sales staff.
          </p>

          <h5>Goals</h5>
          <p>
            I wanted to understand the top pain points that sales staff were having when managing the customer journey to ensure this experience was easily manageable, whilst highlighting key data that would improve day to day operations. Lastly I wanted to ensure the status and communication to the client was seamless to continue to increase subscriptions and aid support staff in client management.

          <h5>Current State Evaluation</h5>
          <p>I started the process by reviewing and documenting the customer journey to gain a full overview of the current situation. In relation to this I reviewed the data that sales staff were required to track, which gave me insights in how to minimise the work required and further assist them by visualising important data. In addition I reviewed the current website that was used by sales staff to review client information. Below are some problems I found:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Insufficient customer account information and data.</li>
            <li>Limited customer account controls.</li>
            <li>Inadequate Customer Search.</li>
            <li>Constrained customer tracking and communication channels.</li>
          </ul>

        <h5>Interviews</h5>
        <p>I started the interview process with a round table interview with the Head of Sales and several sales staff. This revealed how they were managing the clients through the signup process, which was somehow being done with Excel spreadsheets.</p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">Further problems were arising that were starting to impact the customer journey, which included an increasing amount of time it was taking sales staff to track and manage customers. Other issues  I found with this process was it was prone to errors and leads and trial customers were not being communicated to in a timely manner. Sales staff also wanted graphs and charts of key data to be displayed on the dashboard to give them an overview of their work for the day. I worked with the sales staff to come up with a list of useful information that could be turned into charts.</p>

        <h5>Questionnaire</h5>
        <p>I emailed questionnaires to both recently signed up customers and lost leads to see if I could highlight any common good or bad experiences that customers were having. The results were varied but two common themes became obvious:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After the initial demo some customers did not have any follow up communications, leading to lost leads. Other lost leads also reported a several day delay in response to communications and wanted more opportunities for training.</li>
          <li>Customers who signed up did report positive communications with sales staff and the demoâ€™s did a great job of outlining the many features of Nookal. This indicates that improving our response time to Leads and continuing to prioritise demonstrations will continue to help with the growth of Nookal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below are some insights and highlights obtained from the interviews:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Staff need a way to view and manage customers at each step of the journey.</li>
          <li>Staff need to be automatically notified when a customer becomes inactive in the journey.</li>
          <li>Staff want to be able to track their tasks.</li>
          <li>Ability to be able to assign tasks to other staff.</li>
          <li>Want visual elements to give an overview of the situation (charts, graphs).</li>
          <li>Staff are more interested with recent information over the last week.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>User Signup Journey</h5>
        <p>Due to the research it was apparent that changes needed to be made to the user signup journey. Customers requiring a conversion needed specialised service and generally would need more attention from sales staff. Another common problem was that demos were being booked, but not attended. I needed to ensure that sales staff were notified if a demo was not attended, to allow for rebooking.</p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">Sales staff also needed to be notified during the follow-up period once a customer has attended a demo, to ensure any followup questions and concerns could be handled. Lastly I added a section for lost leads for future sales calls.</p>

        <h5>Wireframes and Low Resolution Mockups</h5>
        <p>I started off with a simple wireframe, not worrying about specific elements at this point, instead grouping elements on priority of importance. Next I moved to low-res mockups iterating over the best way to logically show the signup journey. </p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">It was important to some sales staff that they be shown an overview when they first view the dashboard. To facilitate this when initially viewing the dashboard the user is shown the Key Information, with charts shown underneath.  After a user clicks on a card in the key information area. the page updates by replacing the chart with the relevant tasks list.  When viewing the tasks list, clicking on a task animates in a side panel, allowing the user to view and edit the task.</p>

        <h5>Iterations</h5>
        <p>The key information cards went through several iterations to best logically represent the client moving through the different stages. As a result the final design shows the key steps in the clients journey arranged from left to right from Leads to Post Signup, across the screen.</p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">I also decided to make these cards clickable, allowing a user to quickly view the customers in each stage. To give these cards more meaning, I added a subtle chart, showing the activity of each stage over the last week and highlighted the current number of customers in each stage. The My Tasks and All Tasks Cards were also redesigned to be larger, giving these items visual preference as they were more commonly used by staff.</p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">Not all sales staff needed all the chart data, and interviews found that different sales staff required different information, depending on their speciality. In addition showing all charts at once made the screen to busy. As a result I iterated the chart design to show charts depending on a sales staff role in the business.</p>
