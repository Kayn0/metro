        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p class="space-btm-med">
          Nookal is a Practice Management Software Company for the Allied Health Industry. The Nookal Sales Dashboard enables sales staff to effectively manage client information and the signup journey of clients.
        </p>
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p class="space-btm-med">
          Before the existence of the Sales Platform the signup journey was managed with Excel and a basic website showing a client list. Due to the recent growth of the business, effectively managing an increasing number of customers throughout the signup journey was quickly becoming unmanageable.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>
          It was critical to understand the top pain points that sales staff were having when managing the customer journey to ensure this experience was easily manageable. I planned on drilling down in interviews to find out if any additional information would help with their day to day duties. I also wanted to explore how the system could reduce the number of drop offs in the signup journey with the goal of increasing subscriptions.

        <h2>RESEARCH<span>.</span></h2>
        <h4>Current State Evaluation</h4>
        <p>I started the process by reviewing and documenting the customer journey to gain a full overview of the current situation. I reviewed the data that sales staff were required to track, which gave me insights in the day to day duties of sales staff which I could dig into during interviews.</p>

        <h6 class="top-space">Strengths</h6>
        <div class="alt-flexed">
          <div class="note">Staff can look up customer database names.</div>
          <div class="note">Staff can look up customer contact details.</div>
        </div>

        <h6 class="top-space">Weaknesses</h6>
        <div class="flexed">
          <div class="note">Unable to see a  customer’s previous interactions with Nookal.</div>
          <div class="note">Unable to see where a customer is during the signup journey.</div>
          <div class="note">Does not allow a staff to view or manage a customer’s data conversion.</div>
          <div class="note">Unable to see who is managing each customer.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page vert-space-lge">
      <div class="content">
        <h4>Interviews</h4>
        <p>I started the interview process with a round table interview with the Head of Sales and several sales staff. This revealed that they were managing the clients through the signup process with  spreadsheets.</p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">I discovered further problems were arising and were starting to impact customers. It was taking an increasing amount of time to track and manage customers and the processes being used were inconsistent between staff. In addition the process for handling conversions had caused some customers frustrations due to lack of communication.</p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">Below are some insights and highlights obtained from the interviews:</p>
        <div class="flexed-col">
          <div class="points alt">Staff need a way to view and manage customers at each step of the journey.</div>
          <div class="points alt">Staff need to be automatically notified when a customer becomes inactive.</div>
          <div class="points alt">Staff want to be able to view and track their tasks.</div>
          <div class="points alt">Ability to be able to assign tasks to other staff.</div>
          <div class="points alt">Staff need access via tablet and mobile devices whilst out of the office.</div>
        </div>

        <h4 class="space-top-med">Questionnaire</h4>
        <p>I emailed questionnaires to both recently signed up customers and lost leads to see if I could highlight any common good or bad experiences that customers were having. The results were varied but two common themes became obvious:</p>
        <div class="flexed space-top-sml">
          <div class="boxed">Customers who signed up did report positive communications with sales staff and the demo’s did a great job of outlining the features and usefulness of Nookal.</div>
          <div class="boxed">After the initial demo some customers did not receive any follow up communications. Other customers also reported a several day delay in response to communications.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page vert-space-lge">
      <div class="content">
        <h4>Personas</h4>
        <p>The information I had gathered allowed me to create two personas to reflect the research. These personas helped to bridge the research results with the requirements.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h4>Customer Signup Journey</h4>
        <p>Due to the research it was apparent that changes needed to be made to the user signup journey. Customers requiring a conversion needed specialised service and generally would need more attention from sales staff. Another common problem was that demos were being booked, but not attended.</p>
        <p class="space-top-sml">I needed to ensure that sales staff were notified if a demo was not attended, to allow for rebooking. Sales staff also needed to be notified during the follow up period once a customer has attended a demo, to ensure any follow up questions and concerns could be handled.</p>

        <p>I conducted usability testing on this project by creating a series of use cases for staff to complete. The usability tests were done remotely, this allowed be record the results. This provided me with valuable insights to how staff used the platform, which I was able to follow up with questions to validate my findings.</p>
        <p>The key takeaways from this process led to some design changes to reorganise the customer journey, minimise the navigation area, add notes and reorganise  elements on the conversions page.</p>
